# Working With The DOM

Welcome to the sixth lesson! In this lesson, you learn about the Document Object Model, commonly known as **The DOM**. 

**ADD MORE INTRO**

At the end of this lesson, you see a live coding example. The live coding session reinforces what you learn in the lesson. This lesson also helps prepare you for making your personal portfolio site. The code from the session is included in this repository. You can use it however you like, but as with any code you get from someone else, make sure you understand it well enough to explain it to someone before putting it in your own projects.  

In this lesson, you learn:  

Hour 1: What is the DOM
Hour 2: JavaScript's Built-in Functions
Hour 3: Live Coding 

- Hour 1: [What is the DOM](#what-is-the-dom)     
- Hour 2: [JavaScript Builtin Functions](#javascript-builtin-functions)   
- Hour 3: [Live Coding](#live-coding)  

The topics below outline what you learn in the live session. After the live session, you can use this material as a resource for guided self-learning. This document will serve you as a roadmap for gaining repetition with the material that you learned during the live session.   

## [What is the DOM](#what-is-the-dom)    

### Document Object Model  

- DOM is short for Documnet Object Model, which is a   
- When a webpage loads, the browser converts the HTML into a DOM  
- The DOM:    
  -- Defines HTML elements **as objects**  
  -- Defines the properties, methods, and events for HTML elements  
- By defining the HTML elements as object, JavaScript can do things like:  
  -- Get an existing HTML element and read its attributes  
  -- Change an existing HTML element's attributes  
  -- Add a new HTML element and set its attributes   
  -- Remove an existing HTML element or any of its attributes  
  -- Create and execute new HTML events
